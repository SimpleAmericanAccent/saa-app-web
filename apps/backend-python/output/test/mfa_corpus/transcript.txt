 I will finally have getting this to you, but I have been busy over the weekend so now I have a good window to send this audio for you. So my name is Shayla, I live in DC area for the last 10 years and I am a senior accountant here in DC. I work for accounting firm which you have several clients and I have like a set of clients which I work which I provide some bookkeeping, I prepare some reports, I also do their tax so I work with nonprofit organizations and also I also prepare their financial which is the firm 1990. So that's what I do. So more for a problem that I faced a couple months weeks ago was with more for clients which they have been auditing, they have the order which are requesting some documents to us and have some differences between the accounting system, the quick books and the report they provided to us from last year financials. So I'm going to talk with my colleague Amanda to help me solve this problem. So hi Amanda, so I just want to talk to you about our client X which they will have some difference between the quick books and the financial reports that the auditors provided to us. So and I think the difference is in the revenue side and because it's a reconcide account and matches with the report that Barbara provided to us and I think is the prob is on the special project revenue which there are some revenue that was recognized in which I believe was not supposed to be recognized because there are two projects that wasn't that wasn't delivered yet which is going to be delivered this year. So I just want to run this difference with you just to make sure if I'm missing something I just want to run this problem with you to help me how to solve this problem together. I think that's it. Thank you but I have a problem with the word audit. I don't know. I have a problem with so many words but thank forraszam.
